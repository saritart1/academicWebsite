### About me
My name is Sara Restrepo and I am currently working with [Dr. Vesall Nourani](https://sites.google.com/site/vesallnourani) at the [Development Innovation Lab](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/development-innovation-lab/) in studying how knowledge is aggregated socially for economic purposes in predominantly rural and village settings. Previously, I have worked at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en/sharing-knowledge/research-idb) and the [Jain Family Institute](https://jainfamilyinstitute.org/initiatives/guaranteed-income/) on non-conditional cash transfer programs and targeting in the US and LatinAmerica. Also, I worked at [IPA Colombia](https://poverty-action.org/colombia-overview) on gender bias in STEM, non-conditional cash transfer and COVID projects and at the [Central Bank of Colombia](https://investiga.banrep.gov.co/en) on agricultural, credit access projects and monetary policy. 

My main interests are **Community, Education, Value of goods and money.**

I am from a small town called Pereira, in Colombia and love outdoor activities.
