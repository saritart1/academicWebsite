### About me
My name is Sara Restrepo and I am currently working with [Dr. Vesall Nourani](https://sites.google.com/site/vesallnourani) at the Development Innovation Lab in studying how knowledge is aggregated socially for economic purposes in predominantly rural and village settings. Previously, I have worked at the Inter-American Development Bank and the Jain Family Institute on non-conditional cash transfer programs and targeting in the US and LatinAmerica. Also, I worked at IPA Colombia on gender bias in STEM, non-conditional cash transfer and COVID projects and at the Central Bank of Colombia on agricultural, credit access projects and monetary policy. 

My main interests are **Community, Education, Value of goods and money.**

I am from a small town called Pereira, in Colombia and love outdoor activities.
